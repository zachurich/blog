# Zach's Blog
I wanted to have a blog, so I'm building one.
It's being built in Gatsby, a really cool
Jekyll-like static-site generator
based on React.

This is a work in progress.

## From root
`npm install`

Gets all dependencies

## Running in development
`gatsby develop`

Navigate to localhost:8000

## Build
`gatsby build`

Ready to go
